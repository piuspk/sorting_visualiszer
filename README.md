# Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualizer project built with React, allowing you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and dynamic representation of popular sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.

Check out the live demo: [Sorting Visualizer Demo](https://piuspk.github.io/sorting_visualiszer/)

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms in real-time.
- Choose from multiple sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.
- Adjust the array size the visualization.
- Interactive user interface for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- CSS: A stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document.
- JavaScript: A programming language that enables interactive web pages.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting_visualiszer.git
   
2. git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting_visualiszer.git
   cd sorting_visualiszer


3. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

4. Start the development server:

npm start

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Usage

1. On the Sorting Visualizer homepage, you will see a randomly generated array of bars representing the elements to be sorted.

2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.

3. Use the slider to adjust the array size. This will affect the number of bars displayed.

5. Click the button ("What type of sorting do you want") to start the visualization.

6. Observe how the sorting algorithm rearranges the bars to sort the array in real-time.

8. Click the "Reset" button to generate a new random array and start over.

9. Enjoy exploring and learning about sorting algorithms through visualization!
